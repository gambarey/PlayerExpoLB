            "description1": "So the story about Jupiter is already described on the album info, basically this girl I fell in love with went back to her hometown after finishing her degree, and all of a sudden I felt quite miserable and this tune came to my head. This was perhaps the third time the song was recorded. By that time I used to do some live session work as a bassist for Ryan Webb (extremely talented artist, check him out), and since he had a good home studio in Uxbridge and I asked him to trade gigs for studio time. Then Daniel Cardoso (from one of my favourite bands, Anathema) was responsible for the mastering.",
            "description2": "This is the only track to feature a different drummer (Hugo Terva), since it was recorded before Samy started collaborating with the project. Everyone did a great job, including the superb vocals from Pedro Zapata (another super talented musician, you can check his work with the band 'Vintage'). A music video was also made for this song, by spanish video artist Laura del Muro.",

            "description1": "Well, how can I put this. What started up being a 90's progressive power metal track influenced by the likes of Angel Dust or Blind Guardian, ended up being a gargantuan 11 minute long epic with many different sections. But hey, it was great fun to play. Some creative bass stuff as well, plenty of power chords and overdrive, wah tappings etc. I used my first bass for this, a 4-string JP-like korean passive Vantage, which sounded great when distorted.",
            "description2": "The lyrics on the kind of symphonic doom metal intro are actually a latin palyndrome: 'in girum imus nocte et consumimur igni', which translates as something like 'we wander in circles at night and we are consumed by fire'. So if you play it backwards you will still not understand a thing because it's growls. The rest of the lyrics are based on some of my early poems, really doomy and depressive stuff as well. The title translates as 'Winds of Chaos'.",

            "description3": "So why Jupiter: for some time I was a bit obsessed with love, and especially unrequited one. I couldn't understand how the heart could be so wrong, and why is it making you see something as the most true thing in life, but then it's just all in your head pretty much. \n\n So I kind of came into a conclusion, and blamed it on dopamine. That thing your brain releases when you're in love, but also when you take drugs. So basically it works in a very similar way, you can get addicted to / obsessed with that shit. So it all kind of made sense to me, some things are just too good to be true. There's a saying in spanish which goes like 'not all that glitters is gold', especially all that glitters more than gold. I came up with some images which looked like metaphors to me, like Ulysses and the sirens. Some creatures that sing very beautifully, so much that you actually lose your head and head towards it, and then you get devoured if you come too close. So the only options are getting yourself tied to the mast (if you really want to listen) or just put some wax on your ears. \n\n But back to Jupiter, in what has been probably my biggest heart mistake I sent a drunk sms to that person which ended with something like 'blah blah, from (the city I was in at that moment) to the sea (she was originally from a town in the seaside).' Then she replied: 'and from the sea to Jupiter'. \n\n I never quite understood what that meant, but my head kept somehow ruminating on it. Then after another massive disappointment everything appeared to come into place: something that looks like a star from Earth, but it's actually not. It's a planet, a massive one, actually the biggest one in our solar system, but it's made of gas. Still beautiful to grab your attention, but also terribly hostile, since its gravity will crush anything that comes close, and even if you survived " +
                "you would be welcome by a toxic atmosphere and 400 km/h winds. The famous red spot is actually a storm that's bigger than the Earth, and it's been going on for hundreds of years. Jupiter, Dieus Pater, the father of the gods. God is love, they say. \n\n So 'Jupiter' is about that girl, and 'Laura' about the second one. The other songs are not so much related to the concept, to be honest.",

Very adventurous compositions with a great production as well as vocal and instrumental performances. So I contacted the guy, but he said he was based in Indonesia... so for a while we were co-writing online while I tried to find out if there was a way to bring him to London, but none of those plans ended up working out.

This was the manifesto, lengthy but worth (or not) a read: \n\n"
                + "Truñophonic Manifesto \n\n Friends of experimental stuff and booze in general: look no further, this is your band. Truño gourmet. The best worst band in the world. Cubist Rock. Experimental progressive Grunge. Deconstructed Hardcore. Too punk for punks. Wild. Ugly. Mad. Ugly. Shabby. Ugly. Demolishing. Puzzling, why not. A one-way trip to the bottom of your intestines."
                + " Too free. Two drum-kits and half a guitar. Pure spectacle. Alive music, some days goes bad and others worse. Like life itself. Each song is unique, a moment that won't happen again (you will be too drunk to remember...). Each Truño Gourmet show is an exclusive experience, unique, unrepeatable, ephemeral, that will die in time, and won't happen again, like a drunkenness. If you were not there, you lost it forever."
                + " There's no point in making another kind of music today. Truño Gourmet is rock & roll as it should be. It makes no sense to spend more than 70 euros on a guitar, it makes no sense today to record in a device more expensive than a camera. What for? 400 guys will arrive and download it for free, it doesn't matter if you like it or not. The agreement that existed in music has been broken. One of the parties has broken the contract, but the music world goes on as if nothing happened. There are no big differences musicwise between pre and post digital music, including the music before and after internet 'piracy'. Record companies no longer give a shit for any band. The audience does not pay a cent for anything. We the musicians will not be the only morons that spend their money. We no longer owe anyone, at least not to the same extent as before. Now we have won the right to do what we want, which is exactly what everybody does at home or in their offices. And we TRUÑO Gourmet make an incontestable use and abuse of that right. We won't tune our instruments. We'll rehearse if we feel like it, and we will do it drunk. No rehearsal before the show. We'll play when we want and how we want. We'll play the instruments we want. The songs will last what we want. We'll sing if we feel like, and we'll make up the lyrics. Down with the structure. Moreover, rock & roll now has been unmasked. It has been revealed for what it always was: a product, and the alleged attitude around him was nothing but a marketing strategy."
                + " The proof is in its evolution: at first it sold the 'live fast and die young' thing. But the years went by and they didn't die, so all of a sudden the motto changed: 'old rockers never die'. And with this excuse the same four bands keep hogging all the market, drowning the incoming bands. On top of the grotesque, the crowd cheers this pathetic ruse, and pay whatever (even in times of crisis) to see some 60 year guys dressed as if they were 25 and jumping with a guitar. For all this, rock must be grotesque, as deformed as this. It must be horrid, ill-sounding, ugly, so that it reflects the current situation, as in the past it was supposed to be: a reflection of the youth of a situation that blah blah blah. Truño Gourmet is the only true rock & roll band alive. Listening to their music is like smelling a shit that smells good, a praise to the shabby and yet the sublime, if you do not like it it will be like saying that a 3-year-old can paint the Guernica . Truño gourmet. The music of the future, today. Death to the tuner! Long life 70-euros guitars! Freedom for rock & roll!",
